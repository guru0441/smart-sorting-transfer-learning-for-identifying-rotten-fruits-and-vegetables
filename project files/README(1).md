# üçé Smart Sorting: Transfer Learning for Identifying Rotten Fruits and Vegetables

Smart Sorting is an AI-powered solution designed to automate the detection of rotten fruits and vegetables using transfer learning. By fine-tuning pre-trained deep learning models on a custom dataset of produce images, the system enhances quality control across various industries‚Äîfrom large-scale food processing plants to modern smart homes.

## üîç Project Objective

To revolutionize the process of sorting and monitoring fruits and vegetables by:
- Reducing manual labor and human error in sorting.
- Improving accuracy and speed in detecting spoiled produce.
- Minimizing food waste across the supply chain.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Python** üêç
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** üîß
- **Transfer Learning (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet)** üß†
- **OpenCV** üì∑
- **NumPy / Pandas** üìä
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** üìà

## üìÅ Dataset

The model is trained on a curated dataset consisting of:
- Images of **fresh** and **rotten** fruits and vegetables.
- Multiple classes including apples, bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, etc.
- Augmentation techniques applied for improved model generalization.

## üß† Model Architecture

We utilize **transfer learning** to leverage the power of existing deep learning models trained on ImageNet. These models are fine-tuned on our custom dataset to perform binary/multi-class classification.

Typical flow:
1. Load a pre-trained CNN (e.g., MobileNetV2).
2. Freeze the base layers.
3. Add custom classification layers.
4. Train on rotten/fresh datasets.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- High accuracy in detecting rotten produce.
- Real-time image processing support.
- Easily deployable in industrial or home environments.
- Scalable and adaptable for different produce types.

## üß™ Real-World Scenarios

### üì¶ Scenario 1: Food Processing Plants
> Manual sorting in large plants is slow and prone to error. Smart Sorting automates this using conveyor-belt cameras and AI detection systems, improving sorting speed and quality assurance.

### üõí Scenario 2: Supermarkets
> Incoming produce shipments are scanned in real-time to detect rot. This ensures that only fresh items make it to the shelves, enhancing customer trust and reducing waste.

### üè† Scenario 3: Smart Homes
> Smart refrigerators equipped with cameras and Smart Sorting software notify users via a mobile app when food is about to spoil, encouraging timely consumption and reducing household waste.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-sorting-fruits.git
cd smart-sorting-fruits
pip install -r requirements.txt
